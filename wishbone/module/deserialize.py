class Deserialize(FlowModule):

    '''**Deserializes Bulk events or arrays.**

    When incoming data is a Bulk object the content will be forwarded as
    single events again.

    When the incoming data is a single and <source> is a list/array a new
    event is created from each element of the array.

    Parameters:

        - source(str)("data")
           |  The source of the array.
           |  (Ignored when incoming type is Bulk)

        - destination(str)("data")
           |  The destination key to store the array item.
           |  (Ignored when incoming type is Bulk)

    Queues:

        - inbox
           |  Incoming messages

        - outbox
           |  Outgoing messges
