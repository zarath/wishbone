class Switch(FlowModule):

    '''**Switch outgoing queues while forwarding events.**

    Forwards events to the desired outgoing queue based on the value of
    <outgoing>.

    The value of <outgoing> can be dynamically set in 2 ways:

        - Using a lookup value.

        - By sending an event to the <switch> queue with the value of
          <outgoing> stored under *data*.


    Parameters:

        - outgoing(str)("outbox")*
            |  The name of the queue to submit incoming events to.

    Queues:

        - inbox
           |  incoming events

        - switch
           |  incoming events to alter outgoing queue.

        - outbox*
           |  outgoing events

        - <connected_queue_1>
           |  outgoing events

        - <connected_queue_n>
           |  outgoing events
