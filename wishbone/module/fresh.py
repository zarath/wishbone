class Fresh(FlowModule):

    '''**Generates a new event unless an event came through in the last x time.**

    This module forwards events without modifying them. If an event has been
    forwarded it resets the timeout counter back to <timeout>.  If the timeout
    counter reaches zero because no messages have passed through, an event
    with <timeout_payload> is generated and submitted to the module's
    <timeout> queue.  When the a timeout_payload has been sent and the event
    stream recovers, a new event with <recovery_payload> is generated and
    submitted to the <timeout> queue.

    Parameters:

        - timeout_payload(int/float/str/obj/list/...)("timeout")
           |  The data a timeout event contains.

        - recovery_payload(int/float/str/obj/list/...)("recovery")
            |  The data a recovery event contains

        - timeout(int)(60)
           |  The max time in seconds allowed to not to receive events.

        - repeat_interval(int)(60)

           |  The interval time to resend the <payload> event in case
           |  <timeout> has expired and

    Queues:

        - inbox
           |  Incoming events.

        - inbox
           |  Incoming events.

        - timeout
           |  timeout and recovery events.
